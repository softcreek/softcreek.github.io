  <p>Hi there, I'm Jommel.</p>

  <p>
    I like logic and creative things, I like them not sure I do them XD
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked in tech as a software engineer and lead manager since 2012 --

    CV</a>, or read my writings over

  <h2>Software Development</h2>

  <p>Until January 2023, I was working in the corporate world while freelancing as a developer on the side. My career progression includes roles as a software engineer, senior software engineer, and becoming a lead developer of different type of teams.</p>

  <p>Since 2016, I've collaborated with my friend Perry (my former manager from an international company) on multiple software development projects. We've solved dozens to hundreds of software problems and issues during that time. In 2018, Perry decided to make his side projects full-time, quitting the corporate world to focus on freelance projects. In 2019, we reunited, and I believe this is the game-changer for both of us, he pulled me into some of his clients' projects, gaining multiple projects and needing help. I continued to work my full-time job while contributing to our side projects.</p>

  <p>Until January 2023, I committed myself to dedicating time to start our own startup consulting company. Since then, we've been very busy working on our venture.</p>

  <h2>Me</h2>

  <p>
    I spent my childhood mostly playing dirt, basketball, and chess. During my freshman days in high school is when I started to become addicted to computers, mostly for playing XD, although I began learning about computers in my 2nd grade as part of our curriculum, not knowing that this would become my lifelong profession.</p>

  <p>
    Later, I became interested in music and was a member of just-for-fun bands during my high school and college days.
  </p>

  <p>On these days, my hobbies are mostly just "adult stuff," like playing with my kids XD. I am becoming more interested in science stuff, even though I don't understand most of it, but it makes me interested every day.</p>
